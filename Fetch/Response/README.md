# Response
TThe Response interface of the [Fetch API](./../README.md) represents the response to a request.

You can create a new Response object using the Response.Response() constructor, but you are more likely to encounter a Response object being returned as the result of another API operationâ€”for example, a service worker Fetchevent.respondWith, or a simple GlobalFetch.fetch().
