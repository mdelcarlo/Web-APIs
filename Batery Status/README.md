# Batery Status
The Battery Status API, more often referred to as the Battery API, provides information about the system's battery charge level and lets you be notified by events that are sent when the battery level or charging status change. This can be used to adjust your app's resource usage to reduce battery drain when the battery is low, or to save changes before the battery runs out in order to prevent data loss.

The Battery Status API extends window.navigator with a navigator.getBattery() method returning a battery promise, which is resolved in a BatteryManager object providing also some new events you can handle to monitor the battery status.

> **Deprecated** <br>
This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the compatibility table at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.

## Examples
#### Watch for changes to the charging status and for changes to the battery level and timing
Whether or not we're plugged in and charging. This is done by listening for the chargingchange, levelchange, chargingtimechange, dischargingtimechange events.

```js
navigator.getBattery().then(function(battery) {
  function updateAllBatteryInfo(){
    updateChargeInfo();
    updateLevelInfo();
    updateChargingInfo();
    updateDischargingInfo();
  }
  updateAllBatteryInfo();

  battery.addEventListener('chargingchange', function(){
    updateChargeInfo();
  });
  function updateChargeInfo(){
    console.log("Battery charging? "
                + (battery.charging ? "Yes" : "No"));
  }

  battery.addEventListener('levelchange', function(){
    updateLevelInfo();
  });
  function updateLevelInfo(){
    console.log("Battery level: "
                + battery.level * 100 + "%");
  }

  battery.addEventListener('chargingtimechange', function(){
    updateChargingInfo();
  });
  function updateChargingInfo(){
    console.log("Battery charging time: "
                 + battery.chargingTime + " seconds");
  }

  battery.addEventListener('dischargingtimechange', function(){
    updateDischargingInfo();
  });
  function updateDischargingInfo(){
    console.log("Battery discharging time: "
                 + battery.dischargingTime + " seconds");
  }

});
```
